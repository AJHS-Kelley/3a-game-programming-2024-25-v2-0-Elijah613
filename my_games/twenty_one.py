Welcome to TWENTY ONE. This is a card game all based on your luck, however we ran out of cards.
Here's how to play:

The goal is to get the closest to 21. Don't go over 21 or the win will be given to the CPU. You will recieve two cards at the start of each round.
If you want to get another card, say "HIT". Then you will get another card onto your total number.
If you are satisfied with your total, say "STAY". Your turn will be over and the CPU will make its decisions.

After both you and the CPU are done with your turns, the totals and winner will be displayed.
